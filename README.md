## Hiya!

Congrats, you found my GitHub. I’m a dev, student, and chronic system fiddler. If it runs code, I probably tried to modify it at 2am.

These repos are my build log: experiments, questionable ideas that escalated, and projects that actually made it to the finish line. Some overcooked, some speedrun builds, but all real work.

Scroll around. There’s always something brewing, breaking, or getting rebuilt better.
